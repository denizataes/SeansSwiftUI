# Seans App with SwiftUI 🍿

The application is still under development.⚙️‼️

Thanks to the SEANS application, you can meet people through movies and share posts. Not only that, you can instantly access very detailed information about the movie or the actors.

While developing the "SEANS" application, I tried to combine instagram, twitter and imdb applications into a single application.
Enjoy.🥳
